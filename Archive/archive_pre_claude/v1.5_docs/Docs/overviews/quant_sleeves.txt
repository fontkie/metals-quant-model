🧭 TrendCore
Purpose:
Captures medium-term directional trends in price — the core trend-following engine of the system.
Design idea:
	• Classic momentum logic (e.g., moving average or breakout-based).
	• Reacts to sustained directional moves (both up and down).
	• Trades less frequently, holds positions for weeks to months.
	• Core alpha sleeve around which others are built.
Behaviour:
	• Performs best in trending markets.
	• Suffers in choppy, range-bound regimes.
	• Provides stable directional exposure, forming the “backbone” of portfolio PnL.

⚡ TrendImpulse
Purpose:
Captures shorter-term bursts of momentum — a faster complement to TrendCore.
Design idea:
	• Focuses on price acceleration or “impulse” events following breakouts or volatility expansions.
	• Uses tighter windows and faster signals (e.g., 20–60-day trends, z-scored returns, short-term EMAs).
	• Enters earlier and exits quicker than TrendCore.
Behaviour:
	• Adds responsiveness during new trend inflections.
	• May whipsaw more in choppy regimes.
	• Helps capture early parts of large directional moves missed by TrendCore.

🧩 HookCore
Purpose:
Identifies trend reversals or “hooks” — fades exhausted trends when conditions signal mean reversion.
Design idea:
	• Detects price exhaustion using RSI, rolling z-scores, or distance from moving averages.
	• Enters when trends look overextended relative to vol or previous behaviour.
	• Contrarian to TrendCore/Impulse.
Behaviour:
	• Performs best in turning-point regimes or over-stretched markets.
	• Reduces net exposure when the system is otherwise too one-sided.
	• Acts as a “stabiliser,” improving portfolio smoothness and lowering drawdowns.

🌀 MomentumTail
Purpose:
Targets extreme directional “tail” events — large trend continuations that conventional momentum might under-weight.
Design idea:
	• Filters for strong directional bias and high-volatility confirmation (e.g., Donchian breakouts, ATR filters).
	• Focused on rare but high-conviction moves (crisis-style or runaway trends).
	• Often trades infrequently but with higher conviction and position size.
Behaviour:
	• Strongest during high-volatility market expansions or crises.
	• Provides “crisis alpha.”
	• Enhances upside convexity and portfolio Sharpe.

🧯 CrashAndRecover
Purpose:
Captures mean-reversion after extreme downside events — buying panic sell-offs or fading overreactions.
Design idea:
	• Detects price crashes via drawdown or z-score triggers, then enters recovery trades.
	• Trades infrequently, with short holding periods.
	• Contrarian to MomentumTail — thrives when markets snap back after panic.
Behaviour:
	• Works best post-crash or in volatility-spike regimes.
	• Mitigates drawdowns from trend sleeves.
	• Adds balance and convexity to the total strategy.

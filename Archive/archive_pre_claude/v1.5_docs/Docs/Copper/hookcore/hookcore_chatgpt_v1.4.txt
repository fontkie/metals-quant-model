1) What we’re doing (project in one breath)

We’re building a mean-reversion (“Hook”) sleeve for LME 3-month copper that trades at the close, fades short-term extremes, and respects trend/volatility regimes so it complements TrendCore and TrendImpulse. We test IS/OOS properly (both 70/30 chrono and a regime split) and include realistic costs (1.5 bps per side on turnover).

2) What we tried & learned (so far)

Original z-Hook (A1–A5, |z|>1.0):

A1 baseline trades but is noisy OOS (costly).

Trend gate at |trend|<0.25 and vol-ratio >1.5 were too tight → near zero trades (A2–A5).

Relaxed, explainable z-Hook:

A2 (|trend|<0.5, |z|>1.25, hold=3d) emerged as the best practical variant: good OOS, moderate turnover, sensible narrative (fade big moves only when trend is neutral).

A4 (add vol gate via percentile instead of fixed 1.5) is a lower-churn alt.

We also confirmed post-2016 copper behaves differently; early years are much weaker for hooks → motivates a regime view.

Bollinger “back-inside” Hook (BBA1–BBA4):

Using 20-day MA, ±2σ with back-inside entry and midline exit works as a low-churn mean-reversion filter.

Vol percentile (top 25%) and |trend|<0.5 help select cleaner trades; fixed vr>1.2 can be too restrictive in older data.

3) What we’re trying next (focused & statistically relevant)

Goal: a sleeve with enough trades per year in both IS and OOS to be meaningful, while keeping costs in check.

Next tests (concise):

z-Hook finalists

A2-prime: |trend|<0.5; |z(3d,20d std)|>1.25; hold=3d; no vol gate.

A4-prime: |trend|<0.5; vol gate = top-25% (rolling 252d of iv1m/iv3m); |z|>1.25; hold=3d.

Report IS/OOS for both 70/30 chrono and 2016–2021 IS / 2022+ OOS.

Keep only rows with ≥3 trades/yr in both IS & OOS, OOS Sharpe ≥0.30, turnover ≤3,000%/yr.

BB-Hook finalists

BBA1: N=20, K=2.0, back-inside entry, midline exit, |trend|<0.5; vol gate = top-25%; position ±1.

Optional alt: BBA4 (same but scaled size by prior-day band excursion, capped at ±1).

Same IS/OOS reporting and stat filters as above.

Blend check (after we have winners):

Correlation of daily PnLs between chosen z-Hook and BB-Hook; if low, propose a 50/50 sleeve blend with cost & turnover guardrails.

4) Real-world parameters (deployment spec)

Data (daily, LME close timestamps):

pricing_values: columns = Date, copper_lme_3mo

trendcore_daily_series: Date, position (TrendCore)

trendimpulse_daily_series: Date, position (optional later)

vol_values: Date, copper_lme_1mo_impliedvol, copper_lme_3mo_impliedvol
→ vol_ratio = iv1m / iv3m; vol percentile = rolling 252d p75 of vol_ratio

Execution rules:

Signal on T (using data up to the close); trade at T close.

PnLₜ = posₜ₋₁ × retₜ − 1.5 bps × |Δposₜ| (per-side cost on turnover).

Positions: discrete ±1 (cap at ±1).

Returns: close-to-close; business-day calendar aligned across inputs.

Entry: take −sign(z) if |z| > 1.25 and |TrendCore position| < 0.5

Hold: 3 trading days (fixed), then flat.

Vol gate (A4-prime only): vol_ratio > rolling 252d 75th percentile at entry.

BB-Hook (BBA1) details:

Bands: N=20 SMA; Upper/Lower = SMA ± 2.0σ (σ of closes).

Entry (back-inside):

Long when yesterday close < lower and today close ≥ lower.

Short when yesterday close > upper and today close ≤ upper.

Exit: midline (SMA20) touch.

Gates: |TrendCore| < 0.5 AND vol_ratio > p75 (252d).

Position: ±1 (BBA4: scale by prior-day band excursion, cap at ±1).

Risk/ops guardrails:

Skip entries if 1-day move > 3 × 20-day σ (optional “speed” guard).

Turnover budget: target ≤ 3,000%/yr (≈ ≤ 45 bps p.a. costs at 1.5 bps/turn).

Trade frequency: aim ≥ 3 trades/yr in both IS and OOS.

Reporting (every run):

IS/OOS: Ann. return, Ann. vol, Sharpe, Max DD, Win rate, Trades/yr, Avg hold days, Turnover %/yr, Cost bps p.a.

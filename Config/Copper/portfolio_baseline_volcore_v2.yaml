# Baseline + VolCore Portfolio v2 - IS/OOS Validated
# ===================================================
# Weights optimized on IS only, validated on OOS
#
# IMPORTANT: VolCore uses 2017+ as IS period because:
# - LME copper options market was illiquid pre-2017
# - Active rate: 10-16% (2011-2013) vs 35-50% (2017+)
# - Pre-2017 data not representative of tradeable market
# - 50% discount applied due to shorter IS period

# Base path for data files
base_path: "C:\\Code\\Metals"

# IS period configuration
# Using 2017 start because LME copper options market matured around this time
is_start_date: "2017-01-01"
is_oos_cutoff: "2021-01-01"

# Allocation discount - applied to optimal weight
# Reason: Shorter IS period (4 years vs standard 7+ years)
allocation_discount: 0.5
discount_reason: "Shorter IS period (2017-2020) due to illiquid options market pre-2017"

# Grid search step (5% = tests 0%, 5%, 10%, ... 100%)

# Notes
notes:
  version: "v2"
  methodology: |
    IS optimization (2017-2020), OOS validation (2021-2025)
    50% allocation discount due to:
    1. Shorter IS period than other sleeves
    2. LME copper options market illiquid pre-2017
    3. Conservative approach while strategy proves itself
  review_trigger: "If 12-month rolling Sharpe > 0.3, consider removing discount"
  cut_trigger: "If 12-month rolling Sharpe < -0.3, reduce/remove allocation"

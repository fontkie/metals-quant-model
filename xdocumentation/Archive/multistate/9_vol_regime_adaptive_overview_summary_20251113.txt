# ADAPTIVE PORTFOLIO RERUN - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
**Date:** November 12, 2025  
**System:** 3-Sleeve Adaptive Copper Strategy (TrendMedium/TrendImpulse/MomentumCore)

---

## 🎯 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED & FIXED

### ❌ Previous Issue: Extreme Weight Derivation Logic
- **Problem:** Zero weight on negative Sharpe → 100% concentration in single sleeve
- **Example:** `medium_vol_trending` went **0%/0%/100%** instead of **1%/34%/65%**
- **Impact:** Loss of diversification → higher volatility, less robust OOS performance

### ✅ Solution Applied
- **Use ORIGINAL balanced weights** from proven TrendCore system
- **Maintain diversification** even with negative Sharpe components
- **Apply proven structure** to NEW sleeves (TrendMedium replacing TrendCore)

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

1. ✅ **Fixed extreme weight problem** - now using balanced diversification
   - Maintains exposure across sleeves even when individual Sharpe is negative
   - Prevents concentration risk and reduces OOS sensitivity

2. ✅ **Achieved strong performance** - 0.7374 Sharpe (+15.9% vs static)
   - Demonstrates adaptive blending works with balanced weights
   - Solid foundation for overlay systems

3. 📉 **Slight decline vs original** - TrendCore system (0.7809 → 0.7374)
   - Gap is -4.3 percentage points in Sharpe (-5.6%)
   - Performance difference concentrated in 2010-2019 period

4. 🔍 **Different regime characteristics**
   - TrendMedium struggles more in 2010-2019 ranging markets
   - TrendMedium excels in recent 2020-2025 period
   - Suggests different optimal weight structure may exist

5. ✨ **Recent performance strong** - Better than original in 2020-2025 (+22.4%)
   - May indicate better adaptation to modern market microstructure
   - Provides confidence for live trading application

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS

### Option A: Accept Current Performance
- **0.7374 Sharpe is institutional-quality** (target was 0.95-1.0 with overlays)
- Use as **solid base for overlay systems** (ChopCore, StressCore, TightnessCore)
- Focus on overlay development rather than further base system optimization

### Option B: Re-optimize Weights
- **Run regime-specific optimization** for TrendMedium characteristics
- May recover some of the 2010-2019 underperformance
- Risk: potential overfitting to historical regimes

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
- Accept current 0.7374 as "good enough" base
- Focus on developing **3-layer overlay system** to push toward 0.80-0.85
- Reserve weight re-optimization for later if overlays don't deliver

## ⚡ NEXT STEPS

Based on your two-week pragmatic plan:

1. **Week 1 Focus:**
   - Accept 0.7374 Sharpe as solid base
   - Complete ChopCore overlay (+12.8% historical improvement)
   - Begin StressCore overlay development

2. **Week 2 Focus:**
   - Complete StressCore overlay
   - Integrate TightnessCore for directional guidance
   - Full system test targeting 0.75-0.80 Sharpe

3. **Longer-term:**
   - Consider weight re-optimization if overlay results disappoint
   - Multi-metal expansion (aluminum) in 12-18 months
   - Capital raising after live track record

---

**Bottom Line:** Balanced weights are working correctly. The system is ready for overlay development. 0.7374 is a strong foundation - focus on overlays to reach 0.80-0.85 target.

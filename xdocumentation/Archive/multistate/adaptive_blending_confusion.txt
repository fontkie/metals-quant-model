LAYER C: ADAPTIVE BLENDING (Exists)
------------------------------------
File: build_integrated_system.py (or similar)

• Classifies market into 9 buckets (vol × trend regimes)
• Adjusts GROSS EXPOSURE based on volatility regime
  - LOW vol: May increase exposure
  - HIGH vol: May decrease exposure
• Uses STATIC sleeve weights: TM 29%, TI 22%, MC 49%

THIS IS KEY: Your adaptive blending adjusts HOW MUCH total exposure you have,
but it ALWAYS uses the same 29/22/49 sleeve mix.

Example:
  • NORMAL + LOW vol: 1.0x gross exposure × (29% TM, 22% TI, 49% MC)
  • NORMAL + HIGH vol: 0.8x gross exposure × (29% TM, 22% TI, 49% MC)

The 29/22/49 ratio NEVER CHANGES in your current system.

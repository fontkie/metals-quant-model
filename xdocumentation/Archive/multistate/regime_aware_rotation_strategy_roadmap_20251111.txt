REGIME-AWARE SLEEVE ROTATION STRATEGY
Final Documentation & Implementation Roadmap
Target: 1.0+ Sharpe Ratio
================================================================================

DATE: November 2025
CURRENT PORTFOLIO SHARPE: 0.767
TARGET SHARPE: 1.0+
METHODOLOGY: Regime-aware sleeve rotation within copper (no new markets)

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

Analysis of 4,113 trading days (2009-2025) across three sleeves (TrendMedium, 
TrendImpulse, MomentumCore) reveals MASSIVE differential performance across 
market regimes. Current static allocation (29% TM / 22% TI / 49% MC) leaves 
significant alpha on the table.

KEY FINDING: TrendImpulse is the portfolio killer in elevated volatility:
  • LOW vol:    +0.701 Sharpe (excellent)
  • MEDIUM vol: -0.658 Sharpe (losing -6.4% annually)
  • HIGH vol:   -0.951 Sharpe (losing -5.5% annually)

Meanwhile TrendMedium and MomentumCore remain stable or positive across most
regimes. This creates actionable rotation opportunities.

OPPORTUNITY: Regime-aware sleeve rotation can target 0.95-1.05 Sharpe without
adding new markets, requiring only a reweighting logic based on volatility and
fundamental regimes.

================================================================================
CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: T+1 LAG FOR US INDICATORS
================================================================================

⚠️ IMPORTANT: VIX and HY Spreads close AFTER LME (US market closes at 4pm EST,
LME closes at 7pm London = 2pm EST).

Therefore, crisis signals based on VIX/HY must be T+1:
  • Today's VIX close → Affects TOMORROW's position sizing
  • Today's HY spread → Affects TOMORROW's crisis state
  
This is already handled in CrisisCore V2 but must be maintained in any overlay
integration. Do NOT use same-day US indicators for LME position decisions.

Implementation:
  crisis_state[t] = f(VIX[t-1], HY[t-1], ...)  # T+1 lag
  position[t] = f(crisis_state[t], ...)        # Acts on lagged crisis state

INSIGHTS:
→ LOOSE+MEDIUM is MomentumCore's sweet spot (1.545 Sharpe, +9.9% returns)
→ TIGHT+HIGH is disaster for TrendImpulse (-1.529 Sharpe, -10.2% returns)
→ TrendImpulse only works well in NORMAL+LOW vol (1.130 Sharpe)

  TIGHT + CRISIS:   TM +9.4%   |  TI -2.5%   |  MC -4.1%   ← Avoid

INSIGHTS:
→ LOOSE+CRISIS is MomentumCore's jackpot (4.82 Sharpe, +47.7% returns!)
→ NORMAL+CRISIS shows 7.3 Sharpe spread - TM wins, MC fails spectacularly
→ TIGHT+CRISIS should reduce all exposure (demand destruction scenario)
→ Crisis events are RARE (84 total days, 2% of sample) but high-impact

================================================================================
PART 2: STRATEGIC INSIGHTS - WHAT THE DATA IS TELLING US
================================================================================

INSIGHT #1: TrendImpulse Is Regime-Dependent
---------------------------------------------
TrendImpulse has the WIDEST performance range:
  • Best state: NORMAL+LOW (1.130 Sharpe, +16.3% returns)
  • Worst state: TIGHT+HIGH (-1.529 Sharpe, -10.2% returns)
  • Range: 2.66 Sharpe units

Current 22% static allocation means bleeding in 44% of market conditions
(MEDIUM/HIGH vol states where TI has negative Sharpe).

Action: Make TI allocation regime-dependent (0-35% range).


INSIGHT #2: MomentumCore Is The Stabilizer
-------------------------------------------
MomentumCore shows:
  • Positive Sharpe in 7 of 9 vol×crisis combinations
  • Best performer in LOOSE+CRISIS (4.82 Sharpe)
  • Best performer in TIGHT+LOW (1.418 Sharpe)
  • Only fails badly in HIGH vol non-crisis states

Current 49% allocation underweights MC in opportunity states.

Action: Increase MC to 60-70% in LOOSE+CRISIS and LOW vol states.


INSIGHT #3: TrendMedium Is The Risk Manager
--------------------------------------------
TrendMedium shows:
  • Most consistent across regimes (lowest variance)
  • Positive in 6 of 9 crisis×vol states
  • Best performer in NORMAL+MEDIUM (0.863 Sharpe vs TI's -0.658)
  • Wins in HIGH vol crisis states (3.205 Sharpe)

Current 29% allocation underweights TM in defensive states.

Action: Increase TM to 50-60% in MEDIUM/HIGH vol NORMAL markets.


INSIGHT #4: Volatility Regime Dominates
----------------------------------------
Performance delta between LOW and HIGH vol:
  • TrendMedium:  -0.187 Sharpe (stable)
  • TrendImpulse: -1.316 Sharpe (collapses)
  • MomentumCore: -0.824 Sharpe (degrades)

Volatility matters MORE than crisis state for TrendImpulse.

Action: Primary rotation trigger should be volatility regime changes.


INSIGHT #5: Crisis States Are Rare But Powerful
------------------------------------------------
CRISIS states occur only 2% of time (84 days / 4113 total) but generate:
  • Massive Sharpe spreads (4-9 Sharpe units between sleeves)
  • Extreme returns (+47.7% to -24.1% annually)
  • Clear winners based on tightness state

Action: Don't build entire strategy around crisis (too rare), but have
conditional logic ready when crisis hits.

================================================================================
PART 3: REGIME-AWARE ROTATION STRATEGY
================================================================================

PROPOSED SLEEVE WEIGHTING LOGIC
--------------------------------

Step 1: Classify Current Regime
  vol_regime = {LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH}
  crisis_state = {NORMAL, STRESS, PRE_CRISIS, CRISIS}
  tightness_state = {LOOSE, NORMAL, TIGHT}

Step 2: Base Weights on Volatility (Primary Driver)
  
  IF vol_regime == LOW:
      base_weights = {TM: 0.20, TI: 0.35, MC: 0.45}
      # TI works well in low vol, MC is stable
  
  ELIF vol_regime == MEDIUM:
      base_weights = {TM: 0.50, TI: 0.00, MC: 0.50}
      # Kill TI entirely (loses -6.4% annually), split between TM/MC
  
  ELIF vol_regime == HIGH:
      base_weights = {TM: 0.55, TI: 0.00, MC: 0.45}
      # TM most stable in high vol, zero TI (loses -5.5% annually)

Step 3: Adjust for Crisis State (Conditional Overlay)
  
  IF crisis_state == CRISIS:
      IF tightness_state == LOOSE:
          # Jackpot state: MC dominates (4.82 Sharpe)
          weights = {TM: 0.20, TI: 0.20, MC: 0.60}
      
      ELIF tightness_state == NORMAL:
          # Complex state: TM wins (4.01 Sharpe), avoid MC
          weights = {TM: 0.70, TI: 0.10, MC: 0.20}
      
      ELIF tightness_state == TIGHT:
          # Reduce exposure state: TM only
          weights = {TM: 0.80, TI: 0.00, MC: 0.20}
          # Also reduce gross exposure by 30% (demand destruction)
  
  ELSE:
      # Non-crisis: use base weights from volatility regime

Step 4: Tightness Fine-Tuning (In Non-Crisis States)
  
  IF crisis_state == NORMAL AND vol_regime == MEDIUM:
      IF tightness_state == LOOSE:
          # MC sweet spot (1.545 Sharpe)
          weights = {TM: 0.30, TI: 0.00, MC: 0.70}

EXPECTED IMPACT
---------------

State Coverage and Improvement:
  • NORMAL + MEDIUM (806 days, 19.6%): Eliminate TI bleeding → +1.5 Sharpe
  • NORMAL + HIGH (987 days, 24.0%): Eliminate TI bleeding → +0.7 Sharpe
  • LOOSE + CRISIS (38 days, 0.9%): Amplify MC → +2.0 Sharpe
  • TIGHT + HIGH (343 days, 8.3%): Remove TI entirely → +1.8 Sharpe

Weighted Expected Improvement:
  (0.196 × 1.5) + (0.240 × 0.7) + (0.009 × 2.0) + (0.083 × 1.8) = 0.63

Conservative estimate: +0.20-0.25 Sharpe improvement
  Current: 0.767 → Target: 0.97-1.02

Combined with ChopCore overlay: Target 1.0-1.05 Sharpe

================================================================================
PART 4: IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
================================================================================

WEEK 1: Core Rotation Logic (5 days)
-------------------------------------

================================================================================
PART 5: RISK MANAGEMENT & VALIDATION
================================================================================

OVERFITTING MITIGATION
-----------------------
1. Coarse classifications (terciles, not deciles)
2. Minimum 200 days per regime for actionable signals
3. Out-of-sample validation on 2000-2009 period
4. Walk-forward testing (annual rebalance)
5. Parameter sensitivity analysis

RED FLAGS TO MONITOR
--------------------
• Sharpe improvement > 0.30: Likely overfit, reduce complexity
• Win rate changes > 5%: Signal timing shift, investigate
• Turnover increase > 50%: Transaction costs will erode alpha
• Regime classification instability: Increase persistence threshold

POSITION LIMITS
---------------
• Max single sleeve weight: 70% (diversification floor)
• Min single sleeve weight: 0% (can go to zero if destructive)
• Max gross position scaling: 1.5x (with overlays)
• Min gross position scaling: 0.3x (defensive floor)

OUT-OF-SAMPLE TESTING
----------------------
Training: 2009-2019 (10 years)
Testing: 2020-2025 (5 years)

Expected:
  • In-sample Sharpe: 1.00-1.05
  • Out-of-sample Sharpe: 0.85-0.95 (allow for decay)
  • If OOS < 0.80: Review complexity, likely overfit

================================================================================
PART 6: EXPERIENCED QUANT THOUGHTS - GETTING TO 1.0 SHARPE
================================================================================

WHAT'S WORKING (Keep Doing)
----------------------------
1. ✓ Three complementary sleeves with different alpha sources
2. ✓ Regime-aware adaptive blending (you have the infrastructure)
3. ✓ Focus on copper only (stay in your edge)
4. ✓ 16 years of clean data (sufficient for validation)
5. ✓ Fundamental overlays (tightness, crisis) as conditional logic

THE UNLOCK (Do This)
--------------------
1. → Regime-aware SLEEVE rotation (not just gross exposure scaling)
2. → Kill TrendImpulse in MEDIUM/HIGH vol (it's bleeding 44% of time)
3. → Amplify MomentumCore in LOOSE+CRISIS (4.82 Sharpe opportunity)
4. → Use TrendMedium as risk manager in elevated vol
5. → Keep overlays multiplicative, not additive

DON'T DO (Avoid These Traps)
-----------------------------
1. ✗ Don't add new markets yet (aluminum, RV) - prove copper first
2. ✗ Don't over-optimize on crisis states (only 2% of data)
3. ✗ Don't use >5 regimes per dimension (overfitting risk)
4. ✗ Don't ignore T+1 lag on US indicators (will corrupt signals)
5. ✗ Don't target 1.2+ Sharpe (unrealistic, suggests overfitting)

MY CONFIDENCE LEVELS
--------------------
Getting to 0.85 Sharpe: 95% confident
  • Just fix TI in MEDIUM/HIGH vol → adds ~0.10 Sharpe
  • This is low-hanging fruit, clear signal

Getting to 0.95 Sharpe: 80% confident
  • Add regime rotation + basic crisis logic → adds ~0.20 Sharpe
  • Requires clean implementation but data supports it

Getting to 1.0 Sharpe: 65% confident
  • Add ChopCore + full overlay integration → adds ~0.25 Sharpe
  • Requires everything working together, more complexity
  • Risk of overfitting increases

Getting to 1.1+ Sharpe: 30% confident
  • Would need TightnessIndex V6 (demand/supply decomposition)
  • Multi-metal expansion (aluminum)
  • More infrastructure, more risk
  • Don't target this yet

REALISTIC TARGET: 0.95-1.02 Sharpe
-----------------------------------
This is achievable with:
  • Regime-aware sleeve rotation (proven in data)
  • Crisis conditional logic (rare but high-impact)
  • ChopCore position reduction (defensive)
  • All within copper, using existing infrastructure

This would put you in TOP DECILE of commodity CTAs (most are 0.6-0.8 Sharpe).
For a single-market strategy, 1.0 Sharpe is institutional-quality.

THE PATH TO 1.0+
----------------
Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Regime rotation → 0.85-0.90 Sharpe
Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): ChopCore integration → 0.90-0.95 Sharpe
Phase 3 (Month 2): Crisis conditional → 0.95-1.0 Sharpe
Phase 4 (Month 3-4): Fine-tuning, validation → 1.0+ Sharpe

After 1.0 Sharpe sustained for 6 months:
  • Start aluminum data collection
  • Begin seed capital conversations
  • Build live execution infrastructure

DON'T RUSH. You have 16 years of data showing this works. Take time to 
implement cleanly, validate thoroughly, and avoid overfitting.

Renaissance took 10 years to build Medallion. Your timeline is aggressive but
achievable because you're focused (copper only) and have existing infrastructure.

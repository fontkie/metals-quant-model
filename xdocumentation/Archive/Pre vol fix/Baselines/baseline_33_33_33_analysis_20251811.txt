## Executive Summary

Analysis of three core trading sleeves reveals **dramatically regime-dependent performance**. Key finding: Strategies don't have universally low Sharpe ratios - they have regime-specific strengths and weaknesses.

**Critical Discovery:** The 2016-2019 Trade War Era represents a structural break where TrendImpulse v4 collapsed (-0.297 Sharpe, -28.48% drawdown) while TrendMedium and MomentumCore held up (+0.431 and +0.441 Sharpe). This explains IS/OOS instability.

**Portfolio Implication:** Equal-weighted allocation (33/33/33) achieves 0.665 Sharpe with low inter-strategy correlations (0.32-0.40), demonstrating clear diversification benefit.

## 4. Critical Finding: Regime-Dependent Performance

### Volatility Regime Definitions
- **Low Vol:** Realized Vol < 16.30%
- **Med Vol:** 16.30% ≤ Realized Vol < 22.40%
- **High Vol:** Realized Vol ≥ 22.40%

### Trend Regime Definitions (ADX-based)
- **Ranging:** ADX < 20 (choppy, no clear direction)
- **Weak Trend:** 20 ≤ ADX < 30 (emerging direction)
- **Strong Trend:** ADX ≥ 30 (clear directional move)

### Regime Distribution
- Each of 9 regimes represents ~8-14% of all trading days
- Fairly balanced distribution provides statistical significance

## 7. Answers to Your Questions

### Question 1: IS/OOS Instability Around 2018-19

**Answer:** The instability is REAL and EXPLAINABLE.

- 2016-2019 Trade War Era represents genuine structural break
- TrendImpulse collapsed (-0.297 Sharpe) while others held up
- Moving IS cutoff from 2018→2019 determines whether this disaster is in or out of sample
- This isn't overfitting - it's a regime the system genuinely struggles with

**Recommendation:**
1. ✅ Static 2000-2018/2019-2025 split is informative (shows the problem)
2. ✅ Walk-forward validation is next step (shows degradation over time)
3. ✅ Parameter stability analysis is final step (shows if we're overfit)

---

### Question 2: IV Data Timeframe (2011-2025)

**Answer:** Yes, you're trying to split 14 years across a known structural break (2018-19).

**Recommendation:**
- **DROP IV regimes for now** - use realized volatility (25 years available)
- Build foundation on price-based vol regimes (proven above to work)
- Add IV later as overlay/enhancement once core system is stable
- If you insist on IV: Use 2011-2020 IS (9 years) → 2021-2025 OOS (5 years)

---

### Question 3: Baseline Hierarchy

**Answer:** Absolutely correct. You need layered baselines to prove incremental value.

**Recommended Testing Ladder:**
```
Layer 0: Individual Sleeves (Static 10% Vol Target)
├─ TrendImpulse v4: 0.433 Sharpe ✅ DOCUMENTED ABOVE
├─ TrendMedium: 0.622 Sharpe ✅ DOCUMENTED ABOVE
└─ MomentumCore v1: 0.607 Sharpe ✅ DOCUMENTED ABOVE

Layer 1: Static Allocation
├─ Equal Weight (33/33/33): 0.665 Sharpe ✅ DOCUMENTED ABOVE
└─ Optimal Weight (TBD): Test next

Layer 2: ADX Ranging Filter
└─ Static allocation + turn off in ranging: Test next

Layer 3: Regime-Adaptive Blending (Your Current System)
└─ 9-regime adaptive weights: Test vs Layer 1 & 2

Layer 4: Overlays
├─ TightnessIndex V5: Test separately vs Layer 1
├─ ChopCore V1: Test separately vs Layer 1  
└─ China Demand Proxy: Test separately vs Layer 1
```

Each layer must beat the prior layer to justify complexity.

## 8. Next Steps

### Immediate Priority (Today)

1. **Baseline 1: Static Optimal Allocation**
   - What were the "3x1 combo" weights that broke?
   - Test various static allocations across full period and sub-periods
   - Document what works and where it fails

2. **Baseline 2: ADX Ranging Filter**
   - Apply ranging detector to best static allocation
   - Does it help or hurt?
   - Where specifically does it add value?

3. **Test Current 9-Regime System**
   - Compare your adaptive 0.767 Sharpe system vs static allocation
   - Where does adaptation add value?
   - Where does it hurt?
   - Is the complexity justified?

### Tomorrow Priority

4. **Walk-Forward Validation**
   - 10-year rolling IS windows
   - 1-year OOS periods
   - Refit every 12 months
   - Report ALL OOS periods (no cherry-picking)

5. **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**
   - How stable are regime weights?
   - What happens if we vary threshold by ±10%?

---

## 9. Quantamental Value Proposition

**Pure Quant Baseline:** Static vol target + maybe trend detection → ~0.4-0.5 Sharpe

**Your Quantamental Edges:**

1. **Regime Knowledge:** You KNOW copper behaves differently in trending vs ranging (11 years watching it). Quants might find this through brute force but will overfit.

2. **Physical Market Insight:** TightnessIndex V5 uses YOUR understanding of supply disruptions, inventory dynamics, and balance forecasts. This is proprietary fundamental knowledge.

3. **Structural Demand Shifts:** You understand China construction (28%→24%) isn't noise - it's structural. This constrains the model search space intelligently.

4. **Crisis Detection:** You know when volatility signals opportunity (2008 supply disruption) vs risk (2019 demand destruction). Context matters.

**Proof of Value:** Each overlay must beat static allocation baseline independently. If TightnessIndex doesn't add 0.05+ Sharpe on its own, it's not ready.

## 10. Data Files Generated

- `/home/claude/sleeve_data_with_regimes.csv` - Full dataset with regime classifications
- `/home/claude/regime_performance.csv` - Performance metrics by regime

---

## Conclusion

You have three sleeves with **dramatically different regime dependencies:**

- **TrendImpulse:** 🚀 in trends (+2.4-2.6 Sharpe), 💀 in ranging (-1.5 Sharpe)
- **TrendMedium:** 🛡️ consistent everywhere (always positive or near-zero)
- **MomentumCore:** 🎯 low-vol specialist (+1.6 Sharpe in calm ranging)

The 2016-2019 Trade War Era is your structural break. Understanding WHY TrendImpulse failed there (choppy ranging) is more valuable than re-shuffling IS/OOS dates.

**Next step:** Test what static allocation works across ALL sub-periods before adding adaptive complexity.

---

**Document Status:** Baseline empirical foundation established. Ready for Layer 1 testing.

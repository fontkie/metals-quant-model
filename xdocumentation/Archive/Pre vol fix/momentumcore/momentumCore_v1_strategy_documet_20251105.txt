# MomentumCore v1 - Strategy Documentation

**Date:** November 5, 2025  
**Status:** Production  
**Sleeve Position:** Replaces HookCore v4 in 3-sleeve portfolio architecture

---

## Executive Summary

MomentumCore v1 is a pure 12-month Time Series Momentum (TSMOM) strategy based on Moskowitz, Ooi, and Pedersen (2012). It captures long-term trends in copper prices by taking directional positions based on 12-month trailing returns, with volatility scaling to maintain constant risk exposure.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Strategy Type:** Trend-following, long-term momentum
- **Signal Lookback:** 252 trading days (12 months)
- **Position Logic:** Long if price > 12 months ago, Short if price < 12 months ago
- **Volatility Targeting:** 10% annual vol via dynamic leverage scaling
- **Turnover:** 5.5x annually (very low - only rebalances on regime shifts)
- **Standalone Sharpe:** 0.60
- **Portfolio Role:** Diversification sleeve with low correlation to TrendCore/TrendImpulse

## Theoretical Foundation

### Academic Basis: Moskowitz, Ooi, Pedersen (2012)

The strategy implements the seminal "Time Series Momentum" research published in the Journal of Financial Economics. The paper documented that:

1. **Past 12-month returns predict future returns** across 58 liquid futures markets
2. **Works in both directions:** Long past winners, short past losers
3. **Risk-adjusted returns are consistent** when vol-scaled
4. **Uncorrelated to cross-sectional momentum** (relative strength between assets)

### Why It Works on Copper

**Structural factors that support TSMOM in base metals:**

1. **Physical supply/demand constraints:** Unlike equity markets where information adjusts quickly, commodity fundamentals evolve slowly (mine production, infrastructure builds, industrial demand)

2. **Trend persistence:** When copper enters a bull or bear cycle driven by structural factors (China construction, energy transition, supply disruptions), these trends persist for months to years

3. **Slow information diffusion:** Base metals markets have fragmented participant bases (miners, refiners, manufacturers, speculators) with asymmetric information - price discovery is gradual

4. **Behavioral biases:** Market participants under-react to gradual fundamental shifts, creating trend continuation that systematic strategies can capture

**Why 12-month lookback specifically:**
- Short lookbacks (1-3 months) are noisy in commodities - too much mean reversion
- Long lookbacks (12+ months) capture structural regime changes in supply/demand
- Copper's inventory cycles and mine supply adjustments operate on 6-24 month timeframes

## Strategy Implementation

### Signal Generation Logic

**Step 1: Calculate Momentum Signal**
```
past_return = (price_today / price_12m_ago) - 1
signal = sign(past_return)  # +1 if up, -1 if down
```

**Step 2: Volatility Scaling**
```
realized_vol = 60-day exponentially weighted std of returns * sqrt(252)
vol_scalar = target_vol / realized_vol
vol_scalar = clip(vol_scalar, 0, 2.0)  # Cap at 2x leverage
```

**Step 3: Position Sizing**
```
position = signal * vol_scalar
```

**Key Design Choices:**
- **Shift(1) on all signals:** Prevents look-ahead bias - use T-1 signal for T position
- **EWM volatility estimation:** More responsive than simple rolling window
- **2x leverage cap:** Prevents extreme sizing in ultra-low vol environments
- **No filters or overlays:** Pure momentum, no fundamental overlays or regime filters at Layer B

### Parameters (from YAML config)

```yaml
signal:
  momentum:
    lookback_days: 252          # 12 months
    
  vol_scaling:
    lookback_days: 60           # 60-day EWM for realized vol
    target_annual: 0.10         # 10% annual vol target
    max_leverage: 2.0           # 2x leverage cap
    
  directional:
    longs_only: false           # Allow both long and short
```

**Design Philosophy:** All parameters flow from config - zero hardcoding where not needed. Only universal constants (252 days/year, look-ahead bias prevention) are in code.

## Performance Characteristics

### Validated Results (2000-2025, 6,718 observations)

**Risk/Return Profile:**
- **Sharpe Ratio:** 0.60 (vs 0.534 expected from research)
- **Annual Return:** 3.37%
- **Annual Volatility:** 5.62%
- **Maximum Drawdown:** -14.15%
- **Win Rate:** 49.1% (momentum strategies typically ~50%)

**Trading Profile:**
- **Annual Turnover:** 5.5x (extremely low)
- **Transaction Costs:** 1.5 bps per trade
- **Capacity:** Very high due to low turnover
- **Slippage Risk:** Minimal - trades only on regime changes

### Performance vs Other Sleeves

| Sleeve | Sharpe | Vol | Turnover | Correlation to MC |
|--------|--------|-----|----------|-------------------|
| **MomentumCore v1** | 0.60 | 5.6% | 5.5x | 1.00 |
| **TrendCore v3** | 0.51 | 4.6% | ~40x | 0.41 |
| **TrendImpulse v4** | 0.42 | 11.6% | ~25x | 0.32 |

**Key Insight:** MomentumCore has the LOWEST correlation with both existing sleeves (0.32-0.41), providing genuine diversification.

## Portfolio Integration

### Replaces HookCore v4

**Rationale for replacement:**
- **HookCore v4:** Sharpe 0.26 (mean-reversion/reversal strategy)
- **MomentumCore v1:** Sharpe 0.60 (trend-following)
- **Improvement:** +0.34 Sharpe (2.3x better risk-adjusted returns)

**Why reversals failed on copper:**
Copper doesn't exhibit the same short-term mean-reversion patterns as equity indices. When volatility spikes in commodities, it's usually driven by fundamental supply/demand shocks (mine strikes, demand surges) that create sustained trends rather than quick reversals. HookCore was fighting the natural behavior of the asset class.

### Portfolio Allocation

**Recommended: 50% TrendCore / 25% TrendImpulse / 25% MomentumCore**

**Portfolio Metrics:**
- **Current 2-sleeve (50% TC / 50% TI):** Sharpe 0.532
- **3-sleeve optimal allocation:** Sharpe 0.653
- **Improvement:** +0.121 Sharpe (+22.7%)
- **Portfolio Volatility:** 4.94% (DOWN from 6.76% in 2-sleeve)

**Why this allocation works:**
1. **TrendCore (50%):** Highest weight to strongest standalone performer, fast trend capture
2. **TrendImpulse (25%):** Quality momentum with regime awareness, targets low-vol environments
3. **MomentumCore (25%):** Long-term trend capture, smooths portfolio returns, lowest turnover

The 50/25/25 split balances individual sleeve quality with diversification benefits. Equal weight (33/33/33) also works well but slightly underweights your best sleeve (TrendCore).

## Comparative Analysis: MomentumCore vs TrendCore

**Different time horizons, complementary signals:**

| Dimension | TrendCore v3 | MomentumCore v1 |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Lookback** | 5-20 days (adaptive) | 252 days (fixed) |
| **Philosophy** | Fast trend capture | Long-term momentum |
| **Turnover** | ~40x (high) | 5.5x (very low) |
| **Volatility** | 4.6% | 5.6% |
| **Sharpe** | 0.51 | 0.60 |
| **Correlation** | - | 0.41 (low) |
| **Best in** | Fast-moving trends | Structural regime shifts |

**Why both work together:**
- TrendCore catches early trend development (days to weeks)
- MomentumCore catches sustained structural moves (months to quarters)
- Low correlation (0.41) means they're capturing different market dynamics
- When TrendCore whipsaws in choppy markets, MomentumCore provides stability
- When MomentumCore is slow to react, TrendCore provides responsiveness

## When MomentumCore Works Best

### Favorable Market Conditions

**1. Structural Bull/Bear Markets (12+ month trends)**
- Example: 2020-2022 copper bull market driven by green energy transition
- MomentumCore stays long through entire move, minimal turnover
- TrendCore whipsaws on short-term corrections, MomentumCore holds through

**2. Low-Volatility Grind Markets**
- 12-month signal filters out daily noise
- Vol scaling increases leverage in calm markets
- Captures steady directional drift that shorter-term strategies miss

**3. Regime Transitions**
- When markets shift from bear to bull (or vice versa), 12-month lookback confirms regime change
- Less prone to false signals than shorter lookbacks
- Stays positioned through transition volatility

### Challenging Market Conditions

**1. Sharp V-shaped Reversals**
- 12-month lookback is slow to recognize reversals
- Can stay long/short for months after trend breaks
- Example: If copper spikes then crashes within 6 months, signal lags

**2. Range-Bound Chop (6-12 month cycles)**
- If price oscillates around same level over 12 months, signal goes flat
- Zero returns while vol targeting still incurs costs
- Unlike TrendCore which can trade shorter cycles

**3. Volatility Spikes with Quick Mean-Reversion**
- If vol explodes but momentum stays positive, position gets cut
- Can miss follow-through moves if vol drops quickly
- Vol targeting sometimes fights the signal

### Layer A/Layer B Architecture

**Layer B (momentumcore_v1.py):**
- Pure signal generation
- Returns `pos_raw` series with values in continuous range
- Vol-scaled but pre-execution
- No PnL calculation, no cost model

**Layer A (contract.py):**
- Universal execution mechanics
- T+1 PnL accrual
- Transaction cost application (1.5 bps)
- Calendar-aware execution (Mon-Fri)
- Standardized output format

**Separation Benefits:**
- Signal logic testable in isolation
- Execution mechanics consistent across all sleeves
- Easy to swap out Layer B strategies without touching Layer A
- Clean, auditable, defensible

### Data Requirements

**Minimal:**
- Only requires price data: `copper_lme_3mo.canonical.csv`
- No volume, no implied vol, no stock levels, no regime data
- Simplest strategy in the portfolio from a data perspective

**Warmup Period:**
- Requires 252 trading days before first signal (12 months)
- Plus 60 days for vol estimation
- Effective start: ~14 months after data begins

## Maintenance & Monitoring

### What to Monitor

**1. Sharpe Drift:**
- Target: Maintain >0.55 Sharpe
- If drops below 0.45, investigate regime changes
- Expected: 0.50-0.65 range depending on market conditions

**2. Turnover Creep:**
- Target: 5-8x annually
- If exceeds 15x, check for data issues or signal instability
- Should be very stable - only trades on 12-month signal changes

**3. Correlation Stability:**
- Monitor correlation with TrendCore and TrendImpulse
- Target: Stay below 0.50 with both
- If correlations rise above 0.60, diversification benefit degrades

**4. Leverage Usage:**
- Average |position| should be 0.8-1.2x
- If consistently hitting 2x cap, vol targeting may need adjustment
- If consistently below 0.5x, market may be too volatile

### What NOT to Over-Optimize

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Tweaking 12-month lookback (academic consensus, don't fight it)
- ❌ Adding entry/exit thresholds (defeats purpose of pure TSMOM)
- ❌ Incorporating fundamental overlays at Layer B (save for portfolio layer)
- ❌ Changing vol window from 60 days without empirical testing
- ❌ Removing leverage cap (risk management is paramount)

**Philosophy:** This is a research-validated strategy. The edge comes from EXECUTION not OPTIMIZATION. Stick to the academic blueprint.

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements (in order of priority)

**1. Adaptive Portfolio Blending (CURRENT PRIORITY)**
- Dynamic weighting of MC/TC/TI based on market regimes
- Target: Sharpe 0.75+ through regime-aware allocation
- Timeline: Next 4 weeks

**2. Multi-Metal Extension**
- Apply MomentumCore to aluminum, zinc, lead, nickel
- Test if 12-month TSMOM works consistently across base metals
- Potential for metal rotation overlay
- Timeline: Weeks 9-12

**3. Alternative Lookback Periods**
- Test 6-month, 9-month, 18-month variants
- Blend multiple lookbacks for smoother signal
- Only if standalone performance degrades
- Timeline: TBD (only if needed)

**4. Drawdown-Based Position Sizing**
- Reduce exposure during drawdown periods
- Risk management overlay at portfolio level, not sleeve level
- Timeline: Weeks 13-16

### What We Will NOT Do

- ❌ Add fundamental filters (defeats purity of momentum signal)
- ❌ Incorporate volume data (not predictive in commodity futures)
- ❌ Optimize lookback periods (trust the research)
- ❌ Add machine learning (this is a rules-based, interpretable strategy)
- ❌ Combine with cross-sectional momentum (different alpha source)

## Comparison to Industry Benchmarks

### vs CTA/Managed Futures Funds

**Typical CTA TSMOM strategies:**
- Lookback: 3-12 months (varies)
- Vol targeting: 10-15% annually
- Sharpe: 0.3-0.6 (industry standard)
- Turnover: 3-10x annually

**MomentumCore v1 positioning:**
- Sharpe 0.60: **Top quartile** for single-asset TSMOM
- Turnover 5.5x: **Median** range
- Vol 5.6%: Lower than typical (by design - conservative leverage cap)

### vs AQR/Two Sigma Momentum Products

**Similarities:**
- Research-based, not data-mined
- Vol-targeted for consistent risk
- No fundamental overlays at signal level
- Clean implementation with minimal parameters

**Differences:**
- Industry funds blend momentum across 50-100 markets
- We're single-asset (copper only for now)
- Industry uses more sophisticated risk models (we use simple realized vol)
- We have cleaner Layer A/Layer B separation

**Philosophical alignment:** MomentumCore follows Renaissance-style systematic thinking - build multiple uncorrelated sleeves with clean signals, let portfolio construction create alpha.

## Key Takeaways

### For Kieran (Portfolio Manager)

1. **MomentumCore is your diversification anchor:** Lowest correlation with existing sleeves, smooths portfolio returns, minimal turnover costs

2. **It's a structural position, not a tactical trade:** 12-month lookback means you're capturing regime shifts, not short-term moves. Be patient through periods of flat performance.

3. **Priority is adaptive blending, not sleeve optimization:** Don't over-optimize MC individually. The next edge is in WHEN to weight MC vs TC vs TI based on market regimes.

4. **This validates the HookCore replacement:** Moving from reversals (0.26 Sharpe) to momentum (0.60 Sharpe) was the right call. Commodities trend, they don't mean-revert like equities.

5. **You now have a complete 3-sleeve foundation:** TrendCore (fast), TrendImpulse (quality), MomentumCore (structural). Time to build the adaptive regime layer on top.

### For Claude (Future Reference)

1. **MomentumCore is production-ready:** All files follow infrastructure standards, zero unnecessary hardcoding, config-driven, full Layer A/Layer B separation

2. **Performance meets expectations:** 0.60 Sharpe validates the academic research, correlations confirm diversification benefits, portfolio Sharpe improvement (+0.12) is material

3. **Don't suggest optimizing this:** User has learned that 4 solid sleeves with adaptive blending > 9 over-optimized sleeves. Respect the academic foundation.

4. **Next phase is regime framework:** Focus shifts to adaptive portfolio system, macro chop detection, and dynamic weight allocation across MC/TC/TI

5. **Documentation standard:** This doc structure (theory → implementation → performance → portfolio role → maintenance) should be template for all future sleeves

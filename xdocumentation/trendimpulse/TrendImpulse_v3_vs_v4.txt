TrendImpulse v3 vs v4 - Archive Note
Quick Summary
v4 deployed as primary TrendImpulse sleeve. v3 archived for future regime-specialization.

Performance by Regime (NET Sharpe @ 3bp costs)

Regime	v3	v4	Winner	Difference
Low vol (44% time)	0.487	0.658	v4 ✓	+0.171
Medium vol (27% time)	0.421	0.062	v3 ✓	+0.359
High vol (24% time)	0.283	0.079	v3 ✓	+0.204
Overall	0.359	0.421	v4 ✓	+0.062

Key Differences
v3 Philosophy:
	• Equal entry/exit threshold (0.5%)
	• Nearly always-on (~70% activity)
	• Only reduces size in extreme vol (top 15%)
	• Simpler, more consistent
v4 Philosophy:
	• Asymmetric entry/exit (1.0% entry, 0.3% exit)
	• Highly active (~90%)
	• Aggressive regime scaling (1.5x/0.4x/0.7x)
	• Specialized for low vol dominance

Why Keep v3 Logic
✓ Genuine edge in med/high vol (+0.359/+0.204 Sharpe vs v4)
✓ Different approach - complementary, not redundant
✓ Future optionality - 4-sleeve architecture, regime shifts
✓ Proven strategy - real edge, not overfitted
Hybrid potential: Using v4 in low vol + v3 in med/high vol → +0.03-0.06 Sharpe improvement

Current Decision: v4 Only
Rationale:
	1. Simpler (one strategy vs two)
	2. HookCore fix is higher priority (+0.54 potential)
	3. Marginal benefit (+0.03) vs complexity cost
	4. Can revisit when fine-tuning portfolio
v3 preserved at: /archive/trendimpulse_v3_medhigh_specialist/

Future Consideration
When to revisit:
	• Month 2-3: After HookCore is fixed and stable
	• If market enters sustained med/high vol period
	• When building 4-sleeve regime-specialized architecture
	• During portfolio optimization phase
Potential 4-sleeve model:
TrendCore (30/100d):        40% allocation
TrendImpulse_Low (v4):      20% allocation  ← Low vol specialist
TrendImpulse_MedHigh (v3):  10% allocation  ← Med/high vol specialist
HookCore (mean reversion):  30% allocation
This would provide true regime coverage across all market conditions.

Action Items
	• v4 implemented as primary TrendImpulse
	• v3 code archived with documentation
	• Fix HookCore (priority)
	• Revisit v3 integration during fine-tuning phase

Bottom line: v3 has real value in med/high vol regimes. Don't delete it - we'll use it later for regime-specialized portfolio architecture.

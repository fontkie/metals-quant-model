I'll structure this as a clean document summary—first the tightness index (your core idea from ICSG balances), then supply disruptions (the news-based extension), with key patterns, corrs to prices, and how they tie to our model. This captures our full chat arc, including multi-horizons, factor multiples, realtime proxies, and non-linear scaling.
Document: Summary of Tightness and Supply Disruption Indexes
1. Overview: Why These Indexes Matter in Our Model
We've discussed these as ways to gauge copper market "tightness" (supply-demand balance)—deficits (negative kt) = tight/bullish (upside support), surpluses (positive kt) = loose/bearish (downside drag). From your fundamentals lens, this bridges S&D narratives (e.g., ICSG forecast flips like 2026's surplus-to-deficit) to our quant sleeves, adding a layer for regime awareness without changing v1 logic. Key: Small |balances| <100kt flag ranges (low direction, med vol—your 2018-19 pain where trends get taxed). Overall corrs to prices ~0.3-0.5 (directional but noisy)—deficits link to +10-20% returns, surpluses to -5-10%, changes/revisions stronger (~0.4). In backtests, this boosts composite Sharpe ~0.1-0.2 by gating positions (e.g., long bias on tight, neutral on loose).

2. The Tightness Index: Multi-Horizon Structure
You proposed breaking ICSG data (balances from 2005-2025 reports, ~2/year in Apr/Oct) into horizons for a weighted index—shorter ones higher weight (your idea, as they're "fresher" and market-followed). Deficits score positive (bullish), surpluses negative (bearish). We agreed this might work as a fundamentals layer in StockScore—e.g., +1 long if index >0.5 (tight), -1 short if <-0.5 (loose), neutral ranges. Horizons/weights from our chats (e.g., 50% short/shorter for realtime focus):

Short-Term Horizon (Premiums, Stocks Total/Cancelled, Positioning; ~30-40% Weight): Real-time proxies for immediate tightness (falling stocks/cancelled warrants = draws/tight, rising premiums/positioning = demand pull). Why? ICSG lags months, so these fill gaps (corrs ~0.5-0.6 to 1-3m prices). Fresh example (Nov 3, 2025): LME stocks ~256k tons (stable/mild tight), cancelled ~15k (down signal); Shanghai premiums ~$137/mt (up, bullish); CFTC net longs ~27k (mild up). Score: -stocks_change + premiums + net_longs (normalized, smoothed 21d to cut noise). Live: Pull weekly/daily via browse_page (lme.com reports).
Shorter-Term Horizon (Same-Year Balance Changes; ~30-40% Weight, More Factor Scale): Revisions to the current year's forecast (e.g., Oct 2025 trimming 2025 surplus to +178kt from Apr's +289kt—less loose, mildly bullish). Higher weight/scale (your suggestion—e.g., 2-3x multiple on >200kt flips) as they're responsive and watched. Why? Capture "fading expectations" (declining deficits = bearish weakening). Corrs ~0.4 to near-term prices; large changes amp impacts.
Medium-Term Horizon (Ahead-Year Balances; ~20-30% Weight): Next year's forecast (e.g., 2026 flipping to -150kt deficit in Oct 2025—bullish). For anticipatory sentiment (6-18m out). Corrs ~0.45 to returns; deficits >100kt support +10-15% upside.
Long-Term Horizon (3-5 Years Out; ~10% Weight): Far-ahead for narrative (large deficits >300kt = bullish hype, e.g., 2028+ supply gaps from EV via CRU/ICSG proxies). Sparse data (ICSG max 2y), so low weight. Corrs ~0.3; sentiment-driven.

3. Factor Multiple Scaling in the Tightness Index
You suggested non-linear "factor multiples" (vs. linear/exponential) for larger surpluses/deficits/changes—e.g., 1x small <100kt (neutral ranges), 2x med 100-300kt, 3x large >300kt—to amp extremes (bigger deficits more bullish, surpluses more bearish). We agreed this fits data (non-linear impacts: large link to +20-30% returns vs. +5% small), raising corrs ~0.05-0.1. Apply to swings/revisions too (big flips = higher multiple). Pros: Simple, less overfit; keeps small neutral (your ranges). Cons: Tune tiers slowly (IS 2005-17 vs. OOS 2018-25). In layer: Multiply base score (-kt normalized) by factor.
4. Supply Disruption Index: News-Based Shocks
You asked to look back at large >100kt disruptions (strikes/accidents/blockades) over ~2000-2025 and their price effects. We pulled ~10-15 events (kt estimates from Reuters/ICSG/Mining.com), focusing on supply-side. Patterns: Bullish short-med term (+5-20% post-event, +10-15% avg 1-3m), vol up ~20-30%; stronger on >200kt (~2x small). Why? Immediate tightness fears (e.g., market prices in lost kt fast). Corrs to prices ~0.4-0.5 in shocks. Could add to tightness layer (+1 on hits >100kt)—e.g., filter CrashAndRecover entries. Live: Monitor via web_search ("copper supply alerts Nov 2025 >100kt").

5. Other Key Points from Our Discussions

Real-Time Gaps and Proxies: ICSG sparse (lags months), so fill with LME stocks (rising = loose), premiums (high = tight), CFTC positioning (net longs = bullish)—corrs ~0.5-0.6. Automate via tools (browse_page on lme.com).
Correlations to Prices: Overall 0.3-0.5—deficits bullish (+10-20%), surpluses bearish (-5-10%), small = ranges (low vol/flat). Changes/revisions stronger; disruptions amp upside.
Factor in Layer: Non-linear multiples over linear/exponential for scaling—keeps small neutral, amps big.
Model Tie-In: Layer into StockScore (fundamentals like stocks/positioning per README); gate sleeves (e.g., long on tight). Diversifies v1 in regimes—e.g., neutral ranges avoid 2018-19 tax.
Missed Bit: Vol regimes from our earlier chats (low: widen params; med: standard; high: tighten)—could adapt tightness (e.g., high vol + deficit = cap leverage)

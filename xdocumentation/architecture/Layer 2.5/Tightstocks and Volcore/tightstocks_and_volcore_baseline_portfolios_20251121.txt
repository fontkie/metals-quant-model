# TIGHTSTOCKS & VOLCORE VALIDATION RESULTS
## Marginal Contribution Analysis - Complete Summary

**Date:** November 21, 2025  
**Testing Period:** TightStocks 2000-2025 (25 years), VolCore 2011-2025 (14 years)  
**Methodology:** Renaissance-style marginal contribution analysis  
**Objective:** Determine if TightStocks and VolCore add independent value to baseline portfolio

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Result: BOTH SLEEVES VALIDATED ✓**

| Component | Standalone Sharpe | Correlation | Marginal Sharpe | Verdict |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Baseline** | 0.837-0.842 | - | - | Working (full period) |
| **TightStocks** | 0.593 | 0.060 | +0.163 | ✓ ACCEPT |
| **VolCore** | 0.451 | 0.010 | +0.123 | ✓ ACCEPT |

**Key Finding:** Both sleeves add significant independent value (>+0.10 Sharpe) with excellent diversification (<0.1 correlation).

**Recommendation:** Proceed to test three-way combination (Baseline + TightStocks + VolCore).

---

## TESTING METHODOLOGY

### Renaissance-Style Marginal Contribution Framework

**Principle:** Add components separately, measure marginal value, then combine if both pass validation.

**Testing Sequence:**
```
Step 1: Test Baseline alone
  → Establish baseline performance

Step 2: Add TightStocks to Baseline (separately)
  → Measure marginal contribution
  → Test multiple weight allocations
  → Analyze correlation

Step 3: Add VolCore to Baseline (separately)
  → Measure marginal contribution
  → Test multiple weight allocations
  → Analyze correlation

Step 4: If both pass, test all three together
  → Find optimal three-way allocation
  → Validate complementarity
```

### Why Test Separately?

**Avoids combinatorial explosion:** Testing all combinations simultaneously = 2^n combinations.

**Shows individual value:** Know which components contribute and how much.

**Identifies interactions:**
- Complementary: Both add value, combination > sum of parts
- Redundant: Both add similar value, combination ≈ best single
- Conflicting: Combined performance < individual performance

**Informs allocation:** Understand optimal weight ranges for each component.

## ALLOCATION INSIGHTS

### Optimal Two-Way Allocations

**With TightStocks:**
- Primary: 40% Baseline / 60% TightStocks → 1.000 Sharpe
- Balanced: 50% Baseline / 50% TightStocks → 0.986 Sharpe
- Conservative: 60% Baseline / 40% TightStocks → 0.957 Sharpe

**With VolCore:**
- Primary: 60% Baseline / 40% VolCore → 0.966 Sharpe
- Insurance: 75% Baseline / 25% VolCore → 0.959 Sharpe
- Balanced: 50% Baseline / 50% VolCore → 0.928 Sharpe

### Interpretation

**TightStocks** can take majority allocation (60%) due to:
- Higher standalone Sharpe (0.593)
- Proven performance across 25 years
- Strong risk-adjusted returns

**VolCore** works best in supporting role (40% max) due to:
- Lower standalone Sharpe (0.451)
- Insurance properties (works when needed)
- Better as complement to baseline strength

### Regime-Specific Allocations (From Exec Summary)

**Defensive Mode (Baseline broken, 2023-2025):**
```
Baseline:     25%  (broken, reduce exposure)
TightStocks:  40%  (working, primary allocation)
VolCore:      35%  (insurance, increased allocation)
```

**Optimal Mode (Baseline working):**
```
Baseline:     60%  (working, primary allocation)
TightStocks:  25%  (diversifier)
VolCore:      15%  (insurance position)
```

These regime-based allocations leverage:
- TightStocks as primary when baseline fails
- VolCore as insurance in both regimes
- Baseline dominance when working properly

## ECONOMIC RATIONALE

### TightStocks Logic

**Hypothesis:** Physical market tightness predicts copper price movements independent of technical trends.

**Validation:** ✓ Confirmed by 0.060 correlation and +0.163 Sharpe improvement

**Mechanism:**
1. Track LME copper stocks (available supply)
2. Monitor forward curve spreads (market structure)
3. Detect supply disruptions (production shocks)
4. Generate directional signals from fundamental tightness

**Why it works independently:**
- Baseline uses price trends (technical)
- TightStocks uses physical data (fundamental)
- Different information sets → low correlation

### VolCore Logic

**Hypothesis:** Volatility risk premium can be harvested independent of copper direction and fundamentals.

**Validation:** ✓ Confirmed by 0.010 correlation and +0.123 Sharpe improvement

**Mechanism:**
1. Compare implied volatility (option prices)
2. Compare realized volatility (historical moves)
3. Long when IV cheap, short when IV expensive
4. Capture vol mispricing regardless of direction

**Why it works independently:**
- Baseline uses price direction (long/short)
- VolCore uses vol levels (expensive/cheap)
- Orthogonal signals → near-zero correlation

## PERIOD-SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE

### TightStocks Performance Breakdown

**Full Period (2000-2025):** 0.593 Sharpe standalone

**Critical observation:** Need to check recent 2023-2025 period where baseline failed (-0.78 Sharpe). Does TightStocks maintain performance when baseline broken?

### VolCore Performance Breakdown

**Full Period (2011-2025):** 0.451 Sharpe standalone

**Data limitation:** VolCore only available from 2011 (vol spread data inception).

**Critical observation:** Need to verify performance in 2023-2025 defensive period specifically.

---

## THREE-WAY COMBINATION HYPOTHESIS

### Expected Results

Given:
- Baseline: 0.842 Sharpe
- TightStocks: +0.163 marginal (uncorrelated at 0.060)
- VolCore: +0.123 marginal (uncorrelated at 0.010)
- TS-VC correlation: ~0.10 estimated (independent signals)

**Conservative estimate:** 1.05-1.15 Sharpe (three-way optimal allocation)

**Optimistic scenario:** 1.10-1.20 Sharpe (if all three perfectly complement)

### Test Allocations to Try

**Equal weight:**
- 33% Baseline / 33% TightStocks / 33% VolCore

**Defensive (from exec summary):**
- 25% Baseline / 40% TightStocks / 35% VolCore

**Optimal (from exec summary):**
- 60% Baseline / 25% TightStocks / 15% VolCore

**Data-driven grid search:**
- Test combinations in 5% increments
- Find allocation maximizing Sharpe
- Validate with drawdown and correlation analysis

## IMPLEMENTATION ARCHITECTURE

### Layer 3: Portfolio Blending

**Current two-way structure:**
```python
# TightStocks test:
portfolio_pnl = (0.40 × baseline_pnl + 
                 0.60 × tightstocks_pnl)

# VolCore test:
portfolio_pnl = (0.60 × baseline_pnl + 
                 0.40 × volcore_pnl)
```

**Proposed three-way structure:**
```python
# Three-way combination:
portfolio_pnl = (w_base × baseline_pnl + 
                 w_ts × tightstocks_pnl + 
                 w_vc × volcore_pnl)

# Where: w_base + w_ts + w_vc = 1.0
```

### China Demand Overlay Placement

**Critical:** China Demand overlay applies ONLY to baseline, not to TS or VC.

```python
# Step 1: Build component PnLs
baseline_pnl = (TM_pnl + TI_pnl + MC_pnl) / 3
tightstocks_pnl = calculate_TS_pnl()
volcore_pnl = calculate_VC_pnl()

# Step 2: Apply China Demand to baseline only
china_scalar = calculate_demand_scalar(china_ip, lag=2)
baseline_pnl_scaled = baseline_pnl × china_scalar

# Step 3: Blend all three
portfolio_pnl = (w_base × baseline_pnl_scaled + 
                 w_ts × tightstocks_pnl + 
                 w_vc × volcore_pnl)
```

**Rationale:**
- TightStocks already captures demand/supply via stocks and spreads
- VolCore captures vol mispricing, orthogonal to demand
- Applying China Demand to all three would destroy diversification

## TECHNICAL NOTES

### Data Alignment

**TightStocks:** 2000-2025 (6,747 days)  
**VolCore:** 2011-2025 (3,763 days)  
**Common period:** 2011-2025 (3,763 days)

Three-way portfolio will use common period (2011-2025) for apples-to-apples comparison.

### Vol Targeting

All components vol-targeted to 10% annualized:
- Baseline (TM + TI + MC) → 10% each, blended
- TightStocks → 10% portfolio vol
- VolCore → 10% portfolio vol

Blending at Layer 3 maintains proper risk budgeting.

### Transaction Costs

Costs applied at component level:
- Each sleeve has costs in pnl_gross
- Portfolio blending uses gross PnL
- No double-counting of costs
